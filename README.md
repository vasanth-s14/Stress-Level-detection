# Stress-Level-detection
# Domains:
• Machine Learning: Branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and
improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
• Internet of Medical Things (IoMT): Network of interconnected medical devices equipped with sensors
and applications that collect and transmit healthcare data.

# Problem Statement:
• Stress escalates into various serious health problems, ranging from cardiovascular diseases, immune
system imbalances, and gastrointestinal issues to musculoskeletal disorders. In severe cases, stress can
even precipitate heart attacks and fatalities.
• Stress detection in differently abled individuals poses heightened challenges due to communication
barriers, necessitating innovative solutions for early identification and intervention.

# Objective:
This study aims to address the prevalent mental health concern of stress by leveraging IoT sensors in
Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, combined with machine learning
algorithms, to achieve higher accuracy. Through the utilization of real-time physiological data and advanced
analytics, the study seeks to develop a predictive model capable of accurately detecting stress levels among
differently abled individuals.

# Research gap identified:
Current research explores various sensors, such as blood flow, respiration, vibration, optical, temperature, and
accelerometers, to gauge stress levels. However, an alternative approach persists in relying solely on ECG signals
for stress detection. While ECG remains a crucial factor in predicting stress levels, its limitation lies in the
interpretation of heightened heart rates, which could naturally occur during vigorous physical activity. Multi-
sensor approaches, despite their potential, face complexity due to overlapping features and susceptibility to
external factors or health conditions.

# Conclusion:
The prevalence of stress presents significant challenges to overall well-being, especially for differently abled
individuals, who face additional hurdles in stress detection. Integrating IoT and machine learning offers promise
in accurately predicting stress levels, using multimodal signal measurements to enable early detection and
personalized interventions. This approach holds potential for mitigating stress's adverse effects and improving
well-being, marking a transformative era in healthcare delivery applicable to non-verbal populations.
